<!-- 1 Responsive Web Design Principles: Create a Media Query
-->
<!-- Add a media query, so that the p tag has a font-size of 10px when the device's height is less than or equal to 800px.
 -->
 <!-- here's an example of a media query that returns the content when the device's width is less than or equal to 100px:

@media (max-width: 100px) { /* CSS Rules */ }

and the following media query returns the content when the device's height is more than or equal to 350px:

@media (min-height: 350px) { /* CSS Rules */ } -->
<style>
    p {
      font-size: 20px;
    }
  
    /* Only change code below this line */
  
    /* Only change code above this line */
  </style>

  <!-- 2 Responsive Web Design Principles: Make an Image Responsive
-->
<!-- Making images responsive with CSS is actually very simple. You just need to add these properties to an image:

img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
The max-width of 100% will make sure the image is never wider than the container it is in, and the height of auto will make the image keep its original aspect ratio. -->

<!-- Add the style rules to the responsive-img class to make it responsive. It should never be wider than its container (in this case, it's the preview window) and it should keep its original aspect ratio. After you have added your code, resize the preview to see how your images behave.
 -->
 <style>
    .responsive-img {
    
    
    }
    
    img {
      width: 600px;
    }
    </style>

    <!-- 3 Responsive Web Design Principles: Use a Retina Image for Higher Resolution Displays
-->
<!-- The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays, such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is. Here is an example of an image that is only using half of the original height and width:

<style>
  img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
</style>
<img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">-->
<!-- Set the width and height of the img tag to half of their original values. In this case, both the original height and the original width are 200px.  -->
<style>

</style>

<!-- 4 Responsive Web Design Principles: Make Typography Responsive
-->

<!-- The four different viewport units are:

vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
Here is an example that sets a body tag to 30% of the viewport's width.

body { width: 30vw; }
 -->

 <!-- Set the width of the h2 tag to 80% of the viewport's width and the width of the paragraph as 75% of the viewport's smaller dimension.
 -->

 <style>
